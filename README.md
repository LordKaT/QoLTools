# QoLTools
Quality of Life tools for life on linux as a daily driver.

### convert_all.py
Converts all media, recursively, in a folder using ffmpeg.

### qolupdater

Just a simple Quality of Life update service that keeps me semi-sane as a developer.

Keeps systems/repos up to date.

### prompts

Actually useful LLM prompts. Not magical unlocking voodoo. Tells LLMs exactly what to do and how to do it.

### wip

Works in progress. Probably not documented
